You are using a cloud lab VM running on Azure, provided by CyberSoc for a workshop.

Usage Rules
===========
- You must not use this VM for commercial purposes or attempt to interfere with other participant's VMs.
- You must still follow the NUIT policy on the use of IT facilities (https://services.ncl.ac.uk/itservice/rules/) while using this VM, although the service is not provided by NUIT.
- You must not store any important files on this VM as it could be stopped or deleted at any time. You are reponsible for making off-VM backups of anything you don't want to disappear!

Help
====
If you need any help getting your VM working please ask the committee or contact cybersoc@newcastle.ac.uk, this includes password resets or re-imaging of broken VMs.

Hours Allocation
================
Each user is assigned a set quota of hours to use their VM for. Please remember to stop your VM in Azure once you finish using it, or your quota will keep going down until it runs out!

We understand that some users will want extra hours adding to their quota - this is fine, just ask the committee or contact cybersoc@newcastle.ac.uk.

If you would like to use this VM or a similar one outside of scheduled workshops for your own work, you are welcome to but please remember to keep off-VM backups of any important work. Please contact cybersoc@newcastle.ac.uk if you would like us to set up a more appropriate long-term solution for you, we will be happy to help!
